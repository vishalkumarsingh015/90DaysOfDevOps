 working professional with ASP.NET Core Developer Experience
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

I have practical understanding of DevOps culture and practices focused on improving collaboration between development and operations. I work with CI/CD pipelines, Git workflows, and Azure-based deployments to ensure faster releases, automation, and reliable production-level applications. I am familiar with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring basics, and continuous improvement practices.

I have hands-on experience deploying and managing applications on Microsoft Azure, with foundational knowledge of AWS. I understand cloud infrastructure components such as compute services, storage, networking, and managed solutions to build scalable, secure, and cost-effective systems for real-time projects.

✅ Why I'm Learning DevOps & Cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am learning DevOps and Cloud to enhance my ability as a full-stack .NET developer to build, deploy, and manage scalable production-level applications efficiently. I want to automate deployments, improve application reliability, and understand infrastructure along with development. Cloud and DevOps skills help me deliver faster releases, optimize performance, and work effectively in modern Agile environments

✅ Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Microservices & Kubernetes Mastery
Deploy a production-grade microservices application on Kubernetes with auto-scaling, service discovery, monitoring, and GitOps-based deployments to ensure high availability and scalability.
2️⃣ Advanced CI/CD Implementation
Build and manage a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI, including automated testing, security scanning, Docker image management, and blue-green deployment strategy.
3️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Proficiency
Design and manage scalable, multi-environment cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible, ensuring automation, consistency, security, and cost optimization across development, staging, and production environments.

✅ Weekly Time Commitment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Weekdays (Mon–Fri): 2–3 hours daily — focused on hands-on labs, concept learning, and documentation
* Weekends (Sat–Sun): 5–6 hours per day — dedicated to project building, debugging, and writing technical blog posts
* Total Weekly Commitment: Approximately 18–24 hours of consistent DevOps & Cloud practice

✅ Consistency Strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Daily Self-Standup
Start each morning with a 10-minute review to define clear learning goals and tasks for the day.

2️⃣ Public Accountability
Share weekly progress updates on LinkedIn and GitHub to stay committed and build a professional presence.

3️⃣ Hands-On First Approach
Prioritize practical implementation — build, break, and fix — instead of passive watching without execution.

4️⃣ Structured Documentation
Maintain daily notes in a dedicated GitHub repository to track learnings, challenges, and solutions.

5️⃣ No Zero Days Rule
Commit to at least 30 minutes daily; consistency and steady progress matter more than intensity.
